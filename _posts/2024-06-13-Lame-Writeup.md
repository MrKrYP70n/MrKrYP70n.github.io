# Lame (10.10.10.3)

Lame is a very easy HTB machine and a part of old TJ Null list (2021). It requires only one exploit to root the machine. The following exploit can be easily executed with Metasploit or we can use the public exploit script to get the shell as well.

## Recon

### Nmap Scan

Getting started with nmap scan first

![Untitled](Lame%203ee145cbcc7f4e33b4e117343d4b1292/Untitled.png)

Then I ran the full vuln nmap scan and got this output.

## Enumeration

From the Nmap scan I got the versions of all the servies and started searching for vulnerable services version.

### FTP-Enum (vsftpd 2.3.4)

I searched for FTP version and found that it was vulnerable to  Backdoor Command Execution.

[vsftpd 2.3.4 - Backdoor Command Execution](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/49757)

But we need user and password for that.

So, I left that and started enumerating SSH version

### SSH OpenSSH 4.7p1

It is vulnerable to bruteforce attack, but machine was not made to exploit it that way and also the bruteforce was taking it too long ðŸ˜ž

![Untitled](Lame%203ee145cbcc7f4e33b4e117343d4b1292/Untitled%201.png)

It didnâ€™t worked out well. So, I moved on to SMB Enum

### Samba smbd 3.X - 4.X

I searced for its version and found the exploit.

[Msf Exploit Link](https://www.rapid7.com/db/modules/exploit/multi/samba/usermap_script/) - You can follow the exact steps to get it running and root the box.

## Exploit - Root

And the first msf exploit worked and I got root.
